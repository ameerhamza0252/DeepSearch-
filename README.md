# Deep Research System

**Deep Research System** is an AI-powered research framework that orchestrates multiple specialized agents to perform deep, multi-step research. It leverages OpenAIâ€™s SDK, the Gemini API, and OpenAI Tracing to manage, track, and synthesize information efficiently. The system is designed to produce high-quality research reports with minimal human supervision.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* OpenAI Python SDK
* Gemini API Key
* OpenAI Tracing enabled for logs

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

## Usage

Run the main Lead Researcher agent to start a research project:

```bash
python deep_research_system.py
```

* The planning agent will break down your research query into tasks.
* Specialist research agents will gather and verify information.
* The synthesis agent will organize the insights.
* The report writer agent will create the final report.
* Trace logs are available in the OpenAI dashboard for monitoring and debugging.
